    <h2>Vinolia</h2>
    <p>I am Vinolia from South Africa. I live in Pretoria with my wonderful husband our 17 month old baby boy. I have been a member of the church for 15 years now, since I was 15 years old. I served a mission in the Jamaica Kingston Mission, that remains one of the highlihts of my life after being a wife and a mother. </p>
    <p>When I came back from Mission I studied Financial Management in College. I completed my studies right when the pandemic broke and I struggled to find a employment. I obtained a TEFL certificate and I am now an Online English Teacher. I love it and I enjoy meeting people and teaching them but I do not want to do this forever. </p>
    <p>I love Applied Technology and I would like to be either a programmer or a Developer that is why I am studying for my Bachlor in Applied Technology</p>
