To start your journey, go to the next pages which includes questions you might have for your personal journey, your curl type, your porosity and how to proceed on your journey. </p>
       <p >Let us start with answers to some easy beginner questions </p>
      
<p>Frequently asked questions:</p>
<p>1.	Do I need to start over by cutting my hair? No, you can simply transition from straight to curly hair by refraining from using chemicals and heat in your hair. You will also need to use products catered for curly hair. </p>
<p>2.What are specific products I should use on my hair? Products treat everyone differently so you need to find what works for you. A regimen is the most important part even more important than using specific products. </p>
<p>3.	How long will it take my hair to grow after I cut it? Healthy hair grows about 2 inches a month. </p>
<p>4.	Can I dye my hair? You van dye your hair as long as you use plenty of protein in your hair to avoid damage. </p>

      <h3>Hair Porosity</h3>
      
        <p>porosity test.</p>
        <p> Simply take a clean, product-free strand of loose hair and put it in a glass of water. If the hair floats at the top then it is low porosity, if it sinks slowly or settles in the middle it is medium/normal porosity, and if it sinks straight to the bottom then it is high porosity.</p>
        <p>How to maintain High porosity hair?</p>

          <p>Use protein treatments often, such treatments patch up the cuticles and help them become normal for some time. You can buy hair mayonnaise or make your own treatment using eggs, olive oil and yoghurt. Keep it stretched to avoid tangles.Use apple cider vinegar to close the cuticles after washing and conditioning the hair( I use a quarter of a cup of apple cider vinegar and dilute it with two  cups of water). Use thick oils such as ( olive oil, avocado oil, castor oil and butters)Moisturise daily or nightly because the moisture does not stay in the hair. Avoid glycerin it will weigh the hair down and cause frizz.
          </p>
        <p>How to maintain Low porosity hair?</p>
          <p>Use clarifying shampoos to get rid of the build up or use apple cider vinegar to wash the hair. This must not be done regularly. Use stretching to avoid one strand knots. Use deep conditioning treatments to give the hair some moisture. Use humectants such as glycerin and honey to add moisture from the air to your hair. You can use  thin oils to easily penetrate through the hair shaft such as Organ oil, jojoba oil, grape seed oil and almond oil to name a few.

      <h3>Curl Pattern</h3>
      <p>Figure out which curl pattern you have </p>
      <p>Our hair type is determined by our genes and it is easy to look at people with a certain curl type and think oh that is beautiful natural hair. The hair typing system below teaches you which type of hair you have. To do a curl test, wet your hair and remove a follicle from a comb or from the hair. It should be from different parts of the hair because we all curls in one head. It will look like one of the strands in the picture below. Now that you know your hair type, remember that that your hair is beautiful as it is. </p>
      <p>Hair regimen </p>
      <p>A hair regimen is a hair routine for natural hair. A daily regimen  includes:  moisturizing with a liquid and then sealing with an oil. A weekly or bi-weekly regimen includes : prepooing, washing, conditioning and moisturizing.
